## Data for the The President Obama's Proposed Budgets
Each year, after the President's State of the Union address, the Office of Management and Budget releases the Administration's Budget, offering proposals on key priorities and newly announced initiatives. For the last two years of the Obama administration, we are releasing all of the data included in the President's Budget in a machine-readable format here on GitHub.

## About this Repository
This repository includes two branches — one for Fiscal Year 2016 and another for Fiscal Year 2017 — which contain an extract of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) budget database. These files can be used to reproduce many of the totals published in the Budget and examine unpublished details below the levels of aggregation published in the Budget.

The user guide documents found in each branch contain detailed information about the data, its format, and its limitations. In addition, OMB provides [additional data tables, explanations and other supporting documents](https://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/budget/Supplemental) in XLS format on its website.
