## Data for the The President's Fiscal Year 2016 Budget
Each year, after the President's State of the Union address, the Office of Management and Budget releases the Administration's Budget, offering proposals on key priorities and newly announced initiatives. This year, we've been doing things a little differently, from our expanded and enhanced State of the Union coverage to our interview with YouTube creators — and now we're doing the same with the Budget.

That’s why we are releasing all of the data included in this year’s Budget in an easy, machine-readable format here on GitHub. The Budget process should be a reflection of our values as a country, and we think it's important that members of the public have as many tools at their disposal as possible to see what is in the President's proposals — and to have an opportunity to give feedback. And, if they're motivated to create their own visualizations or products from the data, they should have that chance as well.

You can see the [full Budget on Medium].
